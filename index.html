            <li>Kane Williason</li>
            <p>Regarded as the world’s most “complete batsman of this era”, Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson is also
                the complete professional.
                He’s the Black Caps’ most consistent and reliable performer, resulting in eye-wateringly brilliant
                statistics, a swag of individual records, and the infamous moniker ‘Steady the Ship’.

                The reason for Williamson’s consistency is his attention to detail, and a ruthless desire to continue to
                improve himself.

                In a stats sheet littered with stand-out achievements, Williamson’s highlights include: more than 10,000
                first class runs, most test centuries scored by a New Zealand batsman, most test runs in a calendar year
                (2015), and third fastest batsman in the world to reach 6000 ODI runs.

                In 2019 he led his side to the Cricket World Cup final, where the Black Caps fell agonisingly short,
                losing to England on boundary countback. Williamson was named player of the tournament, after becoming
                the highest scoring captain at a single World Cup.

                Known for his sportsmanship as well as his preternatural ability, Williamson is one of the most-loved
                global figures in the sport.</p>

            <p>Amazing, we’re thrilled to hear that you are keeping well. Now some of our readers may know lots about
                you but, for the benefit of those who don’t, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your
                background?

                I started playing Table Tennis when I was 7 years old and I would train for 5-6 hours every day apart
                from attending school.

                In 2001 I won my first National Championship title in Under-14 category and since then I knew that I can
                have a career in Table Tennis and wanted to represent India at the Olympics someday.

                In 2008, when I was 18 years old, I qualified for the Beijing Olympic Games and was the only woman to
                represent India in Table Tennis at the games.

                I was also one of the youngest Indian Olympians in Beijing. Over the course of 14 years of representing
                India, I won 4 national championship titles and several international medals. Some of my key
                international achievements include gold medal at the 2005 World Cadet Challenge and 2008 Commonwealth
                Youth Games and two bronze medals at the 2013 Commonwealth Championships. I also represented India at
                the 2014 Asian Games.

                I retired from competitive sport in 2015 and moved to New York to pursue my Master of Science degree in
                Sports Management from Columbia University, New York, USA. After graduation, I worked at the United
                States Olympic Committee and International Table Tennis Federation. I also worked as a commentator for
                ESPN, USATT and Ultimate Table Tennis League.

                In early 2017, I moved back to India with a vision to make a difference in India’s Olympic movement and
                joined Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ) where I Head Partnerships and Communication and manage the Paralympics
                program. At OGQ, we support the training of some of India’s most talented athletes with a mission to
                help them win Olympic Gold medals. </p>
